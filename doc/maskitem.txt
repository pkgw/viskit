MIRIAD Mask Dataset Item Format
===============================

Abstract Definition
-------------------

A MIRIAD dataset (DS) item in "mask" format defines a sequence of
binary values. Its precise semantics are context-dependent but it
is generally used to flag visibility or image data.

Item Format
-----------

A mask item is a large, i32-formatted MIRIAD DS item. It is
therefore stored as a bytestream on disk in a MIRIAD DS.

The first 4 bytes of a mask item are an item type identifier as
described in "dataset.txt:Large Item Format". 

The rest of the item is a sequence of i32s. Each i32 encodes 31 mask
values in its low 31 bits, with the highest bit being unused. The
final i32 is padded out with one bits as required. External
information is needed to know precisely how many of those values
encode valid information.

No additional structure beyond the stream of binary values is defined
by the format.
