MIRIAD Visibility Dataset Format documentation
==============================================

Abstract Definition
-------------------

A MIRIAD visibility dataset (DS) is a container format for
interferometric visibility data. It is a particular incarnation of the
general dataset (cf dataset.txt) format.

The model for the visibility data is a stream of changing values of
named "UV variables". Each variable is identified by a name and is
described by a type, a size (i.e., the number of instances of the
variable type that constitute a "value" for the variable), and a
value. As the UV data are streamed, the values and *sizes* of various
variables can be updated. The type of a variable may not be updated.
In theory, variable values can be changed arbitrarily, but the
semantics of the UV variables strongly limit the avaiable choices.

The stream of UV variable values is grouped into "records". When the
end of a record is reached, the set of values for all of the defined
variables defines a UV visibility record. Some variables vary for
every record; some never or rarely change.

UV variables are are somewhat similar to DS items (in that they have
names, types, sizes, and values), but should not be confused with
them. DS items can, however, be used to override the values of UV
variables.

As with DS items, UV variable names must be 8 characters or fewer in
length. They must consist of lower-case letters or digits and start
with a letter. A dataset may define no more than 256 UV variables.

*** Standard items

A visibility DS MUST include the following items:

* obstype (short a[*])
  One of the strings "autocorrelation", "crosscorrelation", or
  "mixed-auto-cross". Specifies which sorts of visibilities are
  present in the visibility data.

* vislen (l) [i in MIR3]
  The size of the "visdata" DS item in bytes, plus four???

* ncorr (l) [i in MIR3]
  The number of spectral correlation records in the visibility
  data.

* nwcorr (l) [i in MIR3]
  The number of "wide" correlation records in the visibility data.

* vartable (long a[*])
  A table of the UV variables used in this dataset. Its format is
  specified below.

* visdata (long binary[vislen-4])
  A binary encoding of the stream of UV variables. Its format is
  specified below.

A visibility DS SHOULD include a "history" item as defined for
MIRIAD DSs in general.

A visibility DS MAY include the following items, depending on what
information is available and what operations the user has performed on
the data:

* bandpass (long c)
  Per-antenna bandpass calibrations.

* flags (long i[*])
  A binary encoding of the flag status of the spectral
  correlations. More details below.

* freq0 (d)
  The reference frequency for the delay terms in 'gains'.

* freqs (long binary)
  Table of frequencies used in 'bandpass'.

* gains (long binary)
  Per-antenna gain/phase and delay calibrations.

* interval (d [days])
  The gain interpolation interval allowed.

* leakage (long? c)
  Polarization leakage parameters.

* nchan0 (i)
  "Total number of channels in the bandpass function."

* nfeeds (i)
  The number of feeds on each antenna (1 or 2).

* ngains (i)
  The number of antenna gains in each 'gains' record (> 0).

* nsols (i)
  The number of gains records in 'gains' (> 0).

* nspect0 (i)
  "Number of windows in the bandpass function."

* ntau (i)
  The number of delays per antenna in 'gains' (0 or 1).

* wflags (long i[*])
  A binary encoding of the flag status of the wide correlations.
  More details below.

As mentioned above, a UV DS MAY include further items with the name
of any UV variable. Such items must have the type and dimension 
appropriate for such a variable. Such items override the values of
any instances of their respective UV variables in the UV stream.

UV Data Stream Semantics
------------------------

UV variables and their values can be grouped into various functional
blocks. The details of variables are documented in uvvars.txt. We
omit observatory-specific variables.

*** Visibility data

baseline
coord
corr
npol
pol
time
tscale
wcorr

These variables specify the key data about a single visibility record:
when it was obtained, the antennas involved and the UVW coordinate
they define, and the actual correlations. The UVW coordinates can 
actually be rederived from the timing metadata and the antenna
positions: see the MIRIAD task UVREDO.

*** Visibility secondary data

bin
chi
evector
jyperk
lst
nbin
systemp
ut
veldop
vsource
wsystemp

*** Correlator configuration

freq
inttime
ischan
nchan
nschan
nspect
nwide
restfreq ?

wfreq
wwidth

*** Pointing

Item Formats
------------

*** vartable

The "vartable" item contains a line-oriented textual table listing
the UV variables present in the stream. Each line is formatted
as a single character, followed by a space, follow by a variable
name. Any other line structure is invalid.

The file MUST end with a newline.

The single character specifies the type of the variable using the
usual abbreviations.

Each variable is assigned an integer identifier based on its order
in the file. The variable specified in the first line has an
identifier of 0, the next of 1, and so on. No more than 256 variables
may be defined.

*** visdata

The "visdata" item contains a stream of UV variable names and values
collected into records. Each record is assembled from one or more
entries. The stream of records begins immediately in the item, with
*no* header indicating the format of the item.

Each entry begins with a 4-byte header composed of an i8 ("var"), a byte of
padding, an i8 ("type"), and another byte of padding.

Valid values of "type" are:

0x00 - this is a "size entry"
0x01 - this is a "data entry"
0x02 - "EOR": the current record ends.

If type is not 0x02, the value of "var" specifies the identifier of
the variable whose size or value is being given. This identifier is
derived from the "vartable" DS item.

In the case of a size entry, the header is followed by an i32 giving
the number of bytes in the data entry that will be consumed by
subsequent data entries for the variable. The number of values that
this corresponds to can be computed from the known type of the
variable. This count does not include the padding bytes used to
align the data.

In the case of a data entry, the file is first padded with ignored
bytes to bring the data to an alignment appropriate for the variable
type. (This type is known from the "vartable" DS item.) A number N
elements of the variable's data type then follow, where N is the
most recently specified size for the variable. Sufficient padding
follows to align the bytestream to an 8-byte boundary.

The stream of values MUST end with an EOR indicator.

*** flags

The "flags" item is in the mask format. It defines the flags applied
to the spectral correlation data.

*** wflags

The "wflags" item is in the mask format. It defines the flags applied
to the wideband correlation data.

*** bandpass

TBD.

*** freqs

TBD.

*** gains

TBD.
