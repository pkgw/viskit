MIRIAD UV Variables
===================

Arrays have later indices varying faster a la standard C convention.
This is different than the standard MIRIAD documentation, which uses
the opposite FORTRAN convention.

Most entries are copied out of ATNF MIRIAD documentation with some
annotations.

airtemp r [degrees centigrade]

antaz d[nants] [degrees]

 others (CARMA at least) use 0 = north.

antdiam r [meters]
 Diameter of antenna primary.

antel d[nants] [degrees]

antpos d[3,nants] [nanosec]

  = 2048 * ant1 + ant2 + 65536 if ant1 or ant2 is > 256.

 where ant1 < ant2.
 UVW coordinates of the baseline are XYZ[ant2] - XYZ[ant2]. This
 is the opposite of the AIPS and FITS convention.
